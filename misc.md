# Miscelaneous changes
These are configurations on Windows itself or anything that doesn't require a script.

## Windows
- I disabled all animations on Windows 11, at Accessibility > Visual effects

## Browser
- I use chrome with Vimium extension, which enables me to (almost) only navigate with the keyboard. Any clicking I'll most likely be doing with my thumb on the notebook touchpad.
